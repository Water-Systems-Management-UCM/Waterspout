Vagrant in WSL for Ansible deployment testing on Windows using Hyper-V:

0. Basic Vagrant/Ansible combinations - make sure to name the machine so can set it as a member of an ansible
	group for deployment testing
1. Must run WSL under admin user to use because Vagrant needs to send commands to Hyper-V as an admin - log in as admin if it's a different account, install Ubuntu from Windows Store - can then switch back to your normal account and elevate a command prompt to admin account to access that copy of WSL
2. WSL Vagrant version must match Windows Vagrant version - install vagrant in WSL first to check the version,
then download that version of Vagrant for Windows
3. Need to set a few environment variables to use it in WSL: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/other/wsl.html
	Set the one for enabling windows access, but I also think I needed to set VAGRANT_WSL_WINDOWS_ACCESS_USER_HOME_PATH to the project root to avoid a separate permissions issue.
3. install vagrant and ansible in WSL
4. WSL permissions will make things a bit weird when ansible tries to deploy - it'll see that the private key
	is technically writable by anyone (it's not - Windows will block it, but WSL reports rwx for everyone).
	This blog post describes part of the fix https://www.turek.dev/post/fix-wsl-file-permissions/- create the file at the top, but the fmask value should be 0077 so that all file permissions end up as 600 by default.
	Reboot WSL (which might require rebooting Windows) to apply.
