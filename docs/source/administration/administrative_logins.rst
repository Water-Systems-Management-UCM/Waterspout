Administrative Login
=====================
Waterspout uses separate login systems for the main application
and its administrative interface, but the login systems share
accounts. Your credentials will work in both systems, but the
administrative system has a separate URL.

To log in to the administrative
interface, append :code:`/admin` to the main server URL (e.g.
:code:`https://waterspout.ucmerced.edu/admin`) and enter the same
credentials you use for the main application. After logging in,
the options you see will depend on the capabilities assigned to
you by the application's administrator.
